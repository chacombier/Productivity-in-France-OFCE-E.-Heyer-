These scripts aim at facilitating the exploration of both the National Employment Survey (Enquête Emploi en Continu) and the employment estimations from French trimestrial national account
These files differ from the one used for related publications of the OFCE on the measurement gap between Enquête Emploi en Continu and French National Accounts. Please do not assimilate them!
